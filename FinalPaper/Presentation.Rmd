- Measure to evaluate Machine Learning System
a. Precision
b. Recall
c. F Measure
d. Issues with them
- Alternate Techniques 
1. Accuracy
2. Cohen Kappa



# ROC Analysis
- ROC analysis give geometric insights into the nature of the measures and their sensitivity to skew
- Compare Classifiers
- Choose parameters based on maximization of AUC

# Informedness and Markedness
- Markedness

Markedness quantifies how marked a condition is for the specified predictor, and specifies the probability that a condition is marked by the predictor (versus chance).

Markedness is a deep measure of how consistently the outcome has the Predictor as a Marker by combining surface measures about what proportion of Predictions are correct

Precision + Inverse Precision - $1$

- Informedness

Informedness quantifies how informed a predictor is for the specified condition, and specifies the probability that a prediction is informed in relation to the condition (versus chance).

Informedness is a deep measure of how consistently the predictor predicts the outcome by combining surface measures about what proportion of outcomes are correctly predicted.

Recall + Inverse Recall - $1$

# Regression

- Linear Regression
- Estimating Coefficients
a. Rp
b. Rr
c. Rg

# Conclusion

Infromedness usually is a better evaluation measure in binary classification.

Further work to research into the multiclass application of the technique.

Explore the relationship between Infromedness and Markedness

We have a better and a more intuitive understanding of the mearues that we could use for evaluating our ML system.
