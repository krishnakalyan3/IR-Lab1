# Evaluation : From  Precision, Recall and F-Measure to ROC, Informedness, Markedness and Correlation

### Abstract
- Precison, Recall and Accuracy are biased and we need to understand them
- Try to link Informedness, Markedness, Correlation and Significane with Precision and Recall

### Introduction

### The Binary Case

### Recall and Precision, Sensitivity and Specificity

### Prevalance, Bias, Cost and Skew

### ROC and PN Analysis

### DeltaP and Markedness

### Causality, Correlation and Regression

### Significance and Information Gain

### Confidence Intervals and Devaition

### Simple Examples

### Practical Considerations

### The General Case

### Generalization of Significance

### Generalization of Everness

### Generalization of Confidence

### Exploration and Future Work




### Question

#### Abstract
- What is Rand Accuracy?
- What does dual measure for probability mean?
